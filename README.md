## About Me

I'm a Machine Learning/Computer Vision📷 engineer who loves to build! My current excitement lies in understanding how ML Models can be deployed on the edge, after spending years designing hardware for robots🤖. Check our some of my projects [here](https://karpenet.github.io).

- My team won 🏁 the [F1Tenth](http://karpenet.github.io/f1tenth.html) - Autonomous Racing Challenge 🏎️ at ICRA 2022.
- I also founded [Beeclust - Multi Robot Systems Lab](http://beeclust-mrsl.github.io)🐝 where we [built robots](http://karpenet.github.io/sprinter.html)🤖 and taught them to print🖨️!
